# OS Packages
Trivy is capable of automatically detecting installed OS packages when scanning container images, VM images and running hosts.
This page provides an overview of OS packages in the context of Trivy scans.

## Supported OS

The unfixed/unfixable vulnerabilities mean that the patch has not yet been provided on their distribution.
To hide unfixed/unfixable vulnerabilities, you can use the `--ignore-unfixed` flag.

Trivy doesn't support self-compiled packages/binaries, but official packages provided by vendors such as Red Hat and Debian.

### Data source selection
Trivy **only** consumes security advisories from the sources listed in the above table.

As for packages installed from OS package managers (`dpkg`, `yum`, `apk`, etc.), Trivy uses the advisory database from the appropriate **OS vendor**.

For example: for a python package installed from `yum` (Amazon linux), Trivy will only get advisories from [ALAS][amazon].
But for a python package installed from another source (e.g. `pip`), Trivy will get advisories from the `GitLab` and `GitHub` databases.

This advisory selection is essential to avoid getting false positives because OS vendors usually backport upstream fixes, and the fixed version can be different from the upstream fixed version.
The severity is from the selected data source.
If the data source does not provide severity, it falls back to [NVD][nvd], and if NVD does not have severity, it will be UNKNOWN.

## Distributions
### CBL-Mariner
